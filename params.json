It supports a large number of [visualizations ](http://www.canvasxpress.org/gallery.html)to display scientific and non-scientific\r\ndata. ***canvasXpress*** also includes a standalone unobtrusive data table and a filtering widget to allow data\r\nexploration similar to those only seen in other high-end commercial applications as well as an 'out of the box'\r\nbroadcasting capability to synchronize selected data points in all ***canvasXpress*** plots in a page. Data can\r\nbe easily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically. The fully customizable mouse events\r\nas well as the zooming, panning and drag'n drop capabilities are features that make this library unique in its\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n***canvasXpress*** can be now simply used within R at the console to generate conventional plots, in R-Studio\r\nor seamlessly embeded in [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web applications. This ***CanvasXpress*** library\r\nwas created using the [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nYou can install the latest version of ***canvasXpress*** from GitHub as follows:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github('neuhausi/canvasXpress')\r\n```\r\nAdditional information and many examples with the JavaScript ***canvasXpress*** library can be found\r\n[here](http://www.canvasxpress.org).\r\n",
